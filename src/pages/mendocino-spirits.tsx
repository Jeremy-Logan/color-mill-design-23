In a market where people often choose their drinks based on labels, we knew that Mendocino Spirits needed a brand that was as unique and inspiring as their whiskey in order to attract new and old customers alike. \n\n We've been fans of Mendocino Spirits for years, attending their whiskey dinners and tastings, so we were thrilled when they approached us to do their branding.",

Inspiration was drawn from the deep golden grains, the bright copper still and of course, the amber liquid inside the bottles. We wanted to evoke thoughts of sitting in a velvet parlor chair, sipping a glass of the warming, spicy, smooth whiskey.",

Swirling grains and a distinct font subtly hint at the Art Nouveau style without restricting the brand to that narrow style. The blue evokes images of blue sky above wheat fields, while the copper not only represents the grains, but also the copper stills the spirits spend much of their lives in. ",

Drawing inspiration from the Art Nouveau style, we hand-drew intricate illustrations for each label, capturing the unique essence of the spirits inside. From the warm and spicy winter whiskey to the light and refreshing summer gin, each label was designed to perfectly embody the spirit it represents. We are proud of the result, each of the labels helping Mendocino Spirits to really stand out on any shelf.",
